## Description

Transparency and data privacy concerns are widespread in the sports betting industry, affecting user trust and competition integrity. Platforms like Fantasy Premier League concentrate user squads, making them exposed to breaches and untrustworthy approaches. Such breaches can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of personal data or retroactive changes to team makeup, changing competitive dynamics and harming the confidence of users.

The solution depends on offering users increased transparency and data privacy protections. We hope to develop a sports betting environment that restores confidence, protects user privacy, and promotes integrity through the use of web3 and zero-knowledge proofs. This approach will allow all participants to place bets on sports with confidence, knowing that their data is safe and the competition is fair.

Luffy is the only privacy preserved fantasy football solution in the market. Users can create squads and submit only the hash of the squad on-chain. Users can place their bets on any EVM chain of their choice. Once the gameweek ends, we use chainlink to fetch player performance data from reliable sport APIs and compute the points of the players using our very own custom algorithm. Once the player points are posted on-chain, users can then fetch their squads from the local storage, generate a zero knowledge proof and verify it on-chain to declare the points won without revealing their squad! Now they can claim the rewards based on the points that they earned. We have our cross-chain infrastructure setup using Hyperlane. This entire infrastructure is public, permissionless and automated.

## How is Luffy Different?

Fully Private
The sensitive data is never posted on-chain or stored in a backend, only proven. There are no platforms that do that currently.

Interoperable rewards.
In partnership with Chiliz, we would launch campaigns where the users can get real world perks by using our applications. Being an infrastructure, we would build on top of other web3 applications to attract users by providing interoperable rewards.

UX. fiat onboarding.
We have web2 onboarding in our application. Users can use the app just like how they use other fantasy apps and use FIAT currency to purchase tokens and place bets.
